Hey {name}, 

My name is {yourname}, and I am an A&R rep for HotDrop, which is a music discovery platform that gets artists connected to fans in real time for free.{song_msg} The Wall Street Journal actually just named us one of the best platforms to discover new music (https://www.wsj.com/articles/music-apps-to-discover-tunes-in-new-ways-11670447709).  Itâ€™s 100% free to upload and you keep ownership of your music. There are no loopholes. Our goal is to help emerging artists and connect fans to new music.

Best,
